# Project Overview
This project aims to develop a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) and Campaign Management Application. The primary goal is to enable seamless customer interaction tracking and efficient campaign handling within a single platform. The project involves backend implementation using Spring Boot and frontend development with React.

# Task Details
## Tasks Assigned
1. Implement backend functionality for the CRM using Spring Boot. 

2. Develop the frontend using React.

3. Create a landing page with:
-Project title: Xeno CRM

## Details of CRM and its benefits.

1. Integrate a login page with Google-based authentication.

2. Ensure the web application is intuitive and responsive.

# Work Completed
1. Backend Development:

Set up the Spring Boot project with required dependencies.


Implemented core backend functionalities, including:

(i)Customer data management.

(ii)Campaign tracking features.

(iii)Configured database integration and basic REST APIs.

2. Frontend Development:

Designed the landing page titled Xeno CRM, showcasing:

Overview of CRM benefits (e.g., improved customer interaction, better campaign management).

Created the login page with form inputs for username and password.

3. Integration:

Established a connection between backend REST APIs and frontend components.

## Work Pending

1. Google-Based Authentication:

Integration with Google OAuth 2.0 is partially complete. Currently facing issues with token validation and redirect URIs.

2. Advanced Campaign Analytics:

Detailed analytics for campaigns have not been implemented yet due to time constraints.

3. Frontend Design Enhancements:
The UI needs further refinement to align with modern design standards and improve responsiveness.

## Future Scope

1. Enhanced Features:

Add advanced customer segmentation tools to improve CRM capabilities.

Implement real-time campaign performance dashboards.

2. Scalability:

Optimize the backend to handle large datasets and high traffic.

3. Cross-Platform Availability:

Extend the application to mobile platforms for better accessibility.

4. AI Integration:

Incorporate AI-based insights to recommend optimal campaign strategies and predict customer behavior.

## Challenges Faced

1. Google Authentication:

Understanding OAuth 2.0 workflow and integrating it with the existing architecture.

2. Time Constraints:

Limited time for frontend development led to basic designs without advanced animations or styles.

3. API Testing:
Encountered bugs while testing REST APIs, especially with error handling.

## Conclusion
This project laid a solid foundation for a fully functional CRM and campaign management tool. Although some features are incomplete, the groundwork is ready for further development and scalability.
